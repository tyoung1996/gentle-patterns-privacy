  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>[DATE]</strong></p>
  <hr />

  <p>Gentle Patterns (“the app”) is designed to support reflection and task follow-through in a calm, non-judgmental way. Your privacy is important, and we aim to collect as little data as possible to provide the app’s core functionality.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Information you provide</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Task and reminder content you create in the app</li>
    <li>Optional interactions with the Coach or reflection features</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is stored locally on your device and/or securely synced to support app functionality.</p>

  <p><strong>Automatically collected information</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic, non-identifying usage data (such as app opens or feature usage) may be collected to improve app stability and experience.</li>
    <li>Device information required for app functionality (such as operating system version).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Purchases and Payments</h2>
  <p>If you choose to upgrade to Premium:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payments are processed by Google Play</li>
    <li>The app does not store or process your payment information</li>
    <li>Purchase status is managed securely via a third-party service (RevenueCat) to determine access to premium features</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use collected information only to provide and improve app functionality, enable premium features when applicable, and understand usage patterns to improve the experience.</p>
  <p>We do not sell or share your personal data for advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share personal data with third parties except when required to process subscriptions or app functionality, or when required by law. No data is shared for targeted advertising.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information and minimize data collection. However, no method of electronic storage is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>

    <li>You may delete tasks or content within the app at any time.</li>
    <li>You may uninstall the app to remove locally stored data.</li>
